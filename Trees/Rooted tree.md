## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **rooted tree** is a labelled [[Tree|tree]] in which one specific vertex is marked as being "special". That vertex is called the **root**. 
> 
>If $v$ is a vertex in a rooted tree that has [[Degree|degree]] equal to 1, we say that the vertex is a **leaf** of the tree. The **height** of a vertex in a tree, is the length of the longest path to a leaf from that vertex. The **height** of the tree itself, is defined to be the height of the root. 
> 
> If $u$ and $v$ are vertices in a rooted tree, we say that $u$ is the **parent** of $v$ if $u$ is a [[Adjacent|neighbor]] of $v$, and $u$ is closer to the root than $v$ (in terms of the length of the path from the root to these vertices).
