## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Depth first search** is an algorithm for visiting the nodes of a [[Graph|graph]] in a particular order. Given a graph $G$ and a starting vertex $a$, the algorithm proceeds as follows: 
> 
> 1. Initialize a list $V$ of visited nodes, starting with an empty list.  
> 2. Mark $a$ as visited and add it to the list. 
> 3. Choose any neighbor of $a$. Mark it as visit
