## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Given a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]] $G$, a **minimum spanning tree** is a [[Spanning tree|spanning tree]] such that the sum of the edge weights is the smallest of all spanning trees of $G$. 

Notes: 
- It is possible for a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]] to have more than one minimum spanning tree, that is, more than one [[Spanning tree|spanning tree]] having the same minimum edge weight sum. But, there can only be one minimum edge weight sum. 

## Examples 

Consider this weighted graph:
