## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Given a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]] $G$, a **minimum spanning tree** is a [[Spanning tree|spanning tree]] such that the sum of the edge weights is the smallest of all spanning trees of $G$. 

Notes: 
- It is possible for a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]] to have more than one minimum spanning tree, that is, more than one [[Spanning tree|spanning tree]] having the same minimum edge weight sum. But, there can only be one minimum edge weight sum. 

## Examples 

Consider this weighted graph:

There are several spanning trees for this graph, including: 
* $\{\{0,1\}, \{0,3\}, \{3,4\}, \{0,8\}, \{1,7\}, \{2,7\}, \{2,5\}, \{5,6\}\}$
* $\{\{4,8\}, \{8,0\}, \{0,3\}, \{0,1\}, \{3,2\}, \{1,7\}, \{2,5\}, \{5,6\}\}$

But notice that the weights are
