## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A [[Graph|graph]] $G = (V,E)$ is **bipartite** if we can partition the [[vertex]] set $V$ into two nonempty [[sets]], say $X$ and $Y$, such that every [[Graph|edge]] of the graph has exactly one [[edge|endpoint]] in $X$ and one endpoint in $Y$. 
> 
> A bipartite graph in which each vertex in one of the partitions is connected to *every* vertex in the other partition, is called a **complete bipartite graph**. For a complete bipartite graph, if one of the partitions has $n$ vertices and the other has $m$, w
