## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Given a [[Graph|graph]] $G$, an **edge coloring** of $G$ is a function that assigns to every [[Graph|edge]] of $G$ some label. A **proper edge coloring** is an edge coloring in which [[Adjacent|incident]] edges receive different colors; that is, if two edges have the same color, they cannot be incident (and vice versa).
