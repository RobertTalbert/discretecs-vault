> The **greatest common divisor** or **GCD** of two [[Integers|integers]], which are not both zero, is the largest positive [[Integers|integer]] that [[Divisibility|divides]] both of them. 

Notes: 
- The greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is denoted $\gcd(a,b)$. 
- The GCD is sometimes called the *greatest common factor* or GCF. \
