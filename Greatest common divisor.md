## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **greatest common divisor** or **GCD** of two [[Integers|integers]], which are not both zero, is the largest positive [[Integers|integer]] that [[Divisibility|divides]] both of them. 

**Notes**: 
- The greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is denoted $\gcd(a,b)$. 
- The GCD is sometimes called the *greatest common factor* or GCF. 
- In Python, the GCD is available as a function in the `math` module. Here is an example of use: 

```python
from math import gcd
gcd(10,14)

> 2
```
