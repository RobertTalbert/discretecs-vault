## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Given a [[Graph|graph]] $G$, we say that $G$ has (or contains) an **Eulerian trail** if there is a [[Paths|trail]] that contains all the [[Graph|edges]] of $G$. We say $G$ has (or contains) an **Eulerian circuit** if there is a [[Paths|circuit]] that contains all the edges of $G$. We also say that $G$ is **Eulerian** if $G$ has an Eulerian circuit. 

Notes: 
- Reminders: 
	- A **walk** is a nonempty, alternating sequence of [[Graph|vertices]] and edges that starts and ends with a vertex, and in which every [[Graph|edge]] in the sequence is preceded and succeeded by its endpoints.
	- A **[[trail]]** is a walk with no repeated edge./ 
	- A **[[Paths|circuit]]**
