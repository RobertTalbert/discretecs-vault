## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Two vertices $v$ and $w$ in a graph are said to be **adjacent** if they are the endpoints of an [[Graph|edge]]. We also say that $v$ and $w$ are **neighbors**. 
> 
> An edge in a graph is **incident** to a vertex if that vertex is one of its endpoints. Two edges are said to be **incident** to each other if they have an endpoint in common. 

Notes: 
- The word "incident" has two different uses: One to describe the relationship of an edge to a vertex, and another to describe the relationship between two edges. Be sure to be clear on the context when using that term.

## Examples and Non-Examples

Consider this graph: 
![[degree-graph-example.png]]
In this graph:
- Vertices $1$ and $2$ are adjacent. So are vertices $2$ and $6$. But vertex $1$ is *not* adjacent to vertex $6$,
