## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Given two [[Graph|graphs]] $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$, we say that $G_1$ is a **subgraph** of $G_2$ if there is a copy of $G_1$ contained within $G_2$. More formally: $G_1$ is a subgraph of $G_2$ if there is an [[Injective|injection]] $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ that "preserves edges", in the sense that if $\{u,v\}$ is an edge in $G_1$ then $\{f(u), f(v)\}$ is an edge in $G_2$.
