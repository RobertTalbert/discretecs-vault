## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Prim's Algorithm** is an algorithm for constructing a [[Minimum spanning tree|minimum spanning tree]] inside a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]]. If the graph is unweighted, then Prim's Algorithm will simply build a [[Documents/Graphs/Spanning tree|spanning tree]]. 
> 
> The algorithm works as follows. The input is a [[Connected graph|connected]], [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]] $G$. 
> 1. Choose any edge of smallest weight in $G$. If there is a tie or if $G$ is unweighted, choose randomly from the minimum weight edges. Initialize the spanning tree with this edge. 
> 2. Consider all the edges in $G$ that are incident with a vertex in $T$,
