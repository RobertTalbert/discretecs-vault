## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Prim's Algorithm** is an algorithm for constructing a [[Minimum spanning tree|minimum spanning tree]] inside a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]]. If the graph is unweighted, then Prim's Algorithm will simply build a [[Documents/Graphs/Spanning tree|spanning tree]]. 
> 
> The algorithm works as follows. The input is a [[Connected graph|connected]], [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]] $G$. 
> 1. Select an arbitrary vertex $v$ in $G$ and an empty tree $T$. Add this vertex to $T$. 
> 2. Find all edges in $G$ that are incident with $v$
