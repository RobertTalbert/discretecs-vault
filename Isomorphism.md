## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Two graphs $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ are **isomorphic** if there is a [[Bijective|bijection]] $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ (which we call an **isomorphism**) that preserves the edges exactly in both directions. In other words, $\{u,v\}$ is an edge in $G_1$ if and only if $\{f(u), f(v)\}$ is an edge in $G_2$. 

**Notes**: 
- The practical impact of two graphs being isomorphic, is that they might be represented in ways that appear different, but all the essential structures are the same in both.
