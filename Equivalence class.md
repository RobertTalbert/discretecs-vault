## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Suppose $\sim$ is an [[Equivalence relation|equivalence relation]] on a set $X$, and $a \in X$. Then the **equivalence class** of $a$, denoted $[a]$,  is the set of all elements of $X$ that are related to $a$. That is: 
> $$[a] = \{ x \in X \, : \, a \sim x \}
