## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Brooks' Theorem** states that any graph $G$ satisfies the inequality $\chi(G) \leq \Delta(G)$ where $\chi(G)$ is the graph's [[Chromatic number|chromatic number]] and $\Delta(G)$ is its [[Degree|maximum degree]], unless $G$ is a [[Complete graph|complete graph]] or an odd [[Paths|cycle]], in which case $\chi(G) = \Delta(G) + 1$. 

Notes: 
- Brooks' Theorem is useful as a way to place an upper bound on the [[Chromatic number|chromatic number]] of a graph, or in the case of a [[Complete graph|complete graph]] or odd [[Paths|cycle]] to compute the chromatic number outright. 
- Brooks' Theorem is similar to but different than [[Vizing's Theorem]] which is a [[Theorem|theorem]] about [[Edge coloring|edge coloring]].
