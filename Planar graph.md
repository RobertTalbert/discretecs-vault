## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A [[Graph|graph]] is said to be **planar** if it can be drawn in a plane (for example, on one side of a flat piece of paper) in such a way that no two [[Graph|edges]] intersect, with the only exception being that [[Adjacent|incident]] edges intersect exactly once at their common [[Graph|vertex]]. Such a drawing is called a **planar representation** of the graph. A graph that has no planar representation is called **nonplanar**. 

Notes: 
- A graph is planar if it is *possible* to draw a planar representation. Sometimes graphs may appear at first to be nonplanar b
