## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **proof by contrapositive** is a [[Proof|proof]] of a [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] in which a [[Direct proof|direct proof]] is given for the [[Contrapositive|contrapositive]] of that statement. 

Notes: 
- Since the [[Contrapositive|contrapositive]] of a conditional statement is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the original conditional statement, any correct proof of one suffices as a proof for the other. 
- The contrapositive of a conditional statement is sometimes easier to prove than the original statement, particularly if the original statement involves [[Negation|negations]]. See examples below. 
- A proof by contrapositive is simply a [[Direct proof|direct proof]] of a different statement, so the structure of such a proof is the same as any direct proof: First assume the (new) hypothesis, then proceed using definitions, computations, previously-proven results, or basic facts to explain why the (new) [conclusion](app://obsidian.md/Conditional%20statements) is true.
