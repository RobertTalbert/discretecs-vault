## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> We say the [[integers]] are **closed** under the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication to mean: 
> - The sum of any two integers is another integer. 
> - The difference of any two integers is another integer.
> - The product of any two integers is another integer. 

Note: 
- We take the closure of the integers under addition, subtraction, and multiplication as basic facts about the set of integers, with no proof required. 
- Closure is used mainly in [[Proof|proofs]] to support an argument that a certain computation results in an integer. For example, see the completed proofs in the [[Direct proof]] article. 
- If we replace "the integers" with some other set of numbers, closure may no longer hold. See below for examples. 
- If we replace "addition, subtraction, and multiplication" with other operations, closure may no longer hold. See below for examples. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- If the numbers $2a$ and $2b$ are integers, then $2a+2b$ is an integer because of closure. So are $4ab$ (the product of $2a$ and $2b$) and $2a-2b$. 
- The integers are *not* closed under division, because one integer divided by another does not always result in another integer. For example $3$ and $5$ are integers, but $3/5$ is not. 
- While the integers are closed under subtraction, the [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]] are not. For example $2$ and $7$ are natural numbers but $2-7$ is not, because it's negative. 
- While the integers are closed under addition, the [[subset]] $\{1,3,5\}$ is not: $1$ and $3$ are in this subset but $1+3$ is not.
