## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> We say the [[integers]] are **closed** under the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication to mean: 
> - The sum of any two integers is another integer. 
> - The difference of any two integers is another integer.
> - The product of any two integers is another integer. 

Note: 
- We take the closure of the integers under addition, subtraction, and multiplication as basic facts about the set of integers, with no proof required.
