**Welcome to the vault for Discrete Structures for Computer Science**. This website contains articles for all the important concepts in a two-semester course on discrete mathematics for computer science majors. 

The articles in this vault are **linked together** like Wikipedia articles. if you see underlined text, this is a link to either external webpage (like this) or to another article in the vault (for example, click to read about the [[Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficient]]). This makes it easy to go from one idea to any related idea in one click. 

In the upper right of this page, you can see an **interactive graph view** that shows the current article and its connections to others. The articles are vertices or no in the network, and there is an edge between two vertices if one article links to the other. You can use the graph of you to jump onto any connected article by simply clicking on its vertex. Vertices in the graph that are greyed out indicate articles that have not yet been written.
