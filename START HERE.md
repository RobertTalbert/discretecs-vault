**Welcome to the vault for Discrete Structures for Computer Science**. This website contains articles for all the important concepts in a two-semester course on discrete mathematics for computer science majors. 

> [!important] NOTE FOR FALL 2024
> The updates to this vault from summer 2024 aren't done yet, so there are some topics from graph theory, trees, relations and directed graphs that are incomplete or which haven't been added yet. I'm on it! Expect a complete vault and some updates to older articles by the end of September. 

The articles in this vault are **linked together** like Wikipedia articles. if you see underlined text, this is a link to either external webpage (like this) or to another article in the vault (for example, click to read about the [[Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficient]]). This makes it easy to go from one idea to any related idea in one click. 

The **search bar** in the upper left allows you to perform a full-text search of the entire vault. For example, typing in `proof` brings up a list of all instances of the word "proof" in the vault -- in titles, section headings, and the text of articles. 

In the upper right of this page, you can see an **interactive graph view** that shows the current article and its connections to others. The articles are vertices or no in the network, and there is an edge between two vertices if one article links to the other. You can use the graph of you to jump onto any connected article by simply clicking on its vertex. Vertices in the graph that are greyed out indicate articles that have not yet been written.

This vault was created as a resource for students in MTH 225 and MTH 325 at [Grand Valley State University](http://gvsu.edu). It is free to use by anyone. The articles in the vault are designed to parallel, but not duplicate, content in the course's companion textbook, [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html) by [Oscar Levin](oscar.levin@unco.edu). 

The articles in this vault are also available in the public GitHub repository: https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs-vault.
