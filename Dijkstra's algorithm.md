## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Dijsktra's Algorithm** is a process for finding the shortest [[Paths|path]] between two [[Graph|vertices]] in a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]].

> 1. Select a vertex $v$ in the graph as the starting point. Initialize a table of distances from $v$ to the other vertices in the graph by setting the initial distance to $\infty$ (infinity). Also initialize a list of vertice

Notes: 
- In fact, Dijkstra's algorithm produces a [[Tree|tree]] that contains the shortest path starting from a given vertex to *all* other vertices in the graph.
