## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Dijsktra's Algorithm** is a process for finding the shortest [[Paths|path]] between two [[Graph|vertices]] in a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]]. 
> 
> 1. Select a vertex in the graph as the starting point. 

Notes: 
- In fact, Dijkstra's algorithm produces a [[Tree|tree]] that contains the shortest path starting from a given vertex to *all* other vertices in the graph.
