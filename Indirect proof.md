## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> An **indirect proof**, also called a **proof by contradiction**, is a [[Proof|proof]] of a [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] in which the entire [[Negation|negation]] of the conditional statement is assumed to be true, and then a sequence of logical steps leads to a contradiction of a known fact or previously-proven result. 

Notes: 
- Recall that the [[Negation|negation]] of the conditional statement $P \rightarrow Q$ ("If $P$, then $Q$") is $P \wedge (\neg Q)$ ("$P$ and not $Q$"). 
- Therefore the first step in an indirect proof is to assume *two* statements: The original hypothesis ($P$) and the negation of the conclusion ($\neg Q$). 
- By assuming the negation of the original conditional statement and then showing that this negation leads to a contradiction, we show that the negation of the original statement is false -- therefore the original statement is true. 
- The fact that we assume two statements at the beginning of an indirect proof makes indirect proofs often very effective. 
- The tradeoff, is that there is usually no direct path to the contradiction that needs to be shown. Often the contradiction is quite subtle. 
- Indirect proof is often useful when the hypothesis of the conditional statement contains a "positive" statement but the conclusion contains a negation. 
- Indirect proof can also be used on statements that are not conditional; see example below. 
- [Some mathematicians reject the entire concept of indirect proof](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/111878/why-is-it-considered-unlikely-that-there-could-be-a-contradiction-in-zf-zfc)on logical grounds. And many times, a
