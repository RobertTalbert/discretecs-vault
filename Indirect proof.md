> [!tldr] Definition
> An **indirect proof**, also called a **proof by contradiction**, is a [[Proof|proof]] of a [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] in which the entire [[Negation|negation]] of the conditional statement is assumed to be true, and then a sequence of logical steps leads to a contradiction of a known fact or previously-proven result. 

Notes: 
- Recall that the [[Negation|negation]] of the conditional statement $P \rightarrow Q$ ("If $P$, then $Q$") is $P \wedge (\neg Q)$ ("$P$ and not $Q$"). 
- Therefore the first step in an indirect proof is to assume *two* statements: The original hypothesis ($P$) and the n
