## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Dirac's Theorem** states: 
> If $G$ is a [[Graph|graph]] with $n \geq 3$ vertices, and the degree of each vertex is at least $n/2$, then $G$ has a [[Hamiltonian path and circuit|Hamilton circuit]]. 

Notes: 
- Dirac's Theorem is a corollary to [[Ore's Theorem]]: If the conditions of Dirac's Theorem are met, that is $\deg(u) \geq n/2$ for all vertices $u$, then let $x$ and $y$ be non-[[Adjacent|adjacent]] vertices; we know that $\deg
