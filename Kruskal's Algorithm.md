## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Kruskal's Algorithm** is an algorithm for constructing a [[Minimum spanning tree|minimum spanning tree]] inside a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]].

Notes: 
- [[Prim's Algorithm]] is a different approach that also finds a minimum spanning tree -- not necessarily the same tree as found by Prim's Algorithm but the total weight will be the same.
