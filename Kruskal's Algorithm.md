## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Kruskal's Algorithm** is an algorithm for constructing a [[Minimum spanning tree|minimum spanning tree]] inside a [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]]. 
> 
> The algorithm works as follows. The input is a [[Connected graph|connected]], [[Weighted graph|weighted graph]] $G$. 
> 
> 1. Sort all of the edges of $G$ in non-decreasing order of weight and initialize an empty tree (that will eventually be a minimum spanning tree). 
> 2. Select an edge with minimum weight. Check if it forms a cycle if added to the tree, 

Notes: 
- [[Prim's Algorithm]] is a different approach that also finds a minimum spanning tree -- not necessarily the same tree as found by Prim's Algorithm but the total weight will be the same.
