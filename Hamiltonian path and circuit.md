## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Given a [[Graph|graph]] $G$, we say that $G$ has (or contains) a **Hamiltonian path** (or **Hamilton path**) if there is a path that contains all the [[Graph|vertices]] of $G$. We say $G$ has (or contains) a **Hamiltonian cycle** (or **Hamilton cycle**) if there is a cycle that contains all the vertices of $G$. We also say $G$ **is Hamiltonian** if it has a Hamilton cycle. 

Notes: 
- Reminders: 
	- A **walk** is a nonempty, alternating sequence of [[Graph|vertices]] and edges that starts and ends with a vertex, and in which every [[Graph|edge]] in the sequence is preceded and succeeded by its endpoints. If the walk starts and ends with the same vertex, it is called a **closed walk**. 
	- A **trail** is a walk with no repeated edge. If the trail starts and ends with the same vertex, it is called a **closed trail** or **circuit**. 
	- A **path** is a trail with no repeated vertex. A path consisting of a single vertex is called a **trivial path**. 
	- A **cycle** is a closed trail that has at least three (3) different vertices in it, and the only repeating vertices are the first and the last. 
- Therefore a Hamilton path is a nonempty, alternating sequence of vertices in no edges are
