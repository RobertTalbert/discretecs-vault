## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Let $X$ be a [[Partial ordering|partially ordered set]] with [[Partial ordering|partial ordering]] $\sim$. The **Hasse diagram** for $X$ is a visual diagram similar to a [[Directed graph|directed graph]] but made with slightly different rules: 
> 
> 1. Draw a vertex for each element of $X$, but arrange them visually so that if $a \sim b$ in the [[Partial ordering|poset]], the vertex for $a$ appears lower in the drawing than the vertex for $b$. 
> 2. The vertices for $a$ and $b$ are joined by a line segment (not an arrow) if $a \sim b$ ignoring
