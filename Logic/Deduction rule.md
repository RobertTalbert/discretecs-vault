## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **deduction rule** is an argument form consisting of a collection of [[Propositions|statements]] called the **premises** (plural of the word "premise") and a single statement called the **conclusion**, in which the conclusion is true whenever the premises are all true. In such cases we say the deduction rule is **valid**. 

**Notes**
- The term "conclusion" here is not the same as when we use that term to describe a part of a [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]]. The [[Conditional statements|conclusion]] of a [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] is simply the [[Atomic and molecular propositions|atomic statement]] that follows the "then" in the phrase "If $A$, then $B$". For a deduction rule, the conclusion can be a [[Atomic and molecular propositions|molecular statement]]. 
- A deduction rule is said to be **invalid** if there is a situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion is false. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

**Example**: Consider the deduction rule whose premises are the two [[Propositions|statements]] $P \rightarrow Q$ and $P$, and in which the conclusion is $Q$. We sometimes denote this in a table-like form: 

$$\begin{array}{c} P \to Q \\[8pt] P \\[8pt] \overline{\hspace{2cm}} \\[8pt] \therefore Q \end{array}$$
A natural-language version of this deduction rule might go like this: 
- If it's raining, then my windshield wipers will come on. ($P \rightarrow Q$)
- It's raining. ($P$)
- Therefore, my windshield wipers will come on. ($Q$)
This is a common form of argument known as [modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens). To check to see that this deduction rule is valid, make a [[Truth tables|truth table]] that includes all the [[Atomic and molecular propositions|atomic statements]] and a column for each of the premises and the conclusion: 

| $P$ | $Q$ || $P \rightarrow Q$ |
