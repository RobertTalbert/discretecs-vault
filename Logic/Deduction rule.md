## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **deduction rule** is an argument form consisting of a collection of [[Propositions|statements]] called the **premises** (plural of the word "premise") and a single statement called the **conclusion**, in which the conclusion is true whenever the premises are all true. In such cases we say the deduction rule is **valid**. 

Notes
- The term "conclusion" here is not the same as that term used to describe a part of a [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]]. The [[Conditional statements|conclusion]]
