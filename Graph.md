## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **graph** is a pair of [[Set|sets]]: 
> 1. A nonempty set called the **vertex set**, whose elements we call **vertices** or **nodes**. 
> 2. A (possibly empty) set called the **edge set**, whose elements we call **edges**, where each edge is a [[Subset|subset]] of the vertex set that contains exactly two elements (called the **endpoints** of the edge). 
>    
>  We often use $G = (V,E)$ to denote a graph whose name is $G$, whose vertex set is $V$, and whose edge set is $E$. 

Notes: 
- The definition of a graph is rather abstract because we want room to represent graphs in different ways: both visually, and as pure data structures in several different forms. 
- Note that the edge set of a graph is a set, whose elements are also sets -- namely, two-element subsets of the vertices.
