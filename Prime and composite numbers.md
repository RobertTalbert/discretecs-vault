## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A positive integer $n$ is said to be **composite** if it can be written as $n = ab$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers greater than $1$. The positive integer $n$ is said to be **prime** if it is not composite; that is, if it has only two factors, $n$ and $1$. 

Notes:
- Note, the number $1$ is neither prime nor composite; and negative numbers are also neither prime nor composite. 
- If $n$ is a composite number with $n = ab$, then writing $n = ab$ is called a *factorization* of $n$. Writing a positive integer $n$ as $n = p_1 p_2 p_3 \cdots p_k$ for some natural number $k$ where each $p_i$ is prime, is called a *prime factorization*.
