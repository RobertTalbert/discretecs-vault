## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **direct proof** is a [[Proof|proof]] applied specifically to a [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] which is structured as follows: 
> 1. Assume that the [[Conditional statements|hypothesis]] of the conditional statement is true; 
> 2. Then use definitions, computations, previously-proven results, or basic facts to explain why the [[Conditional statements|conclusion]] of the conditional statement is true. 

Notes: 
- A direct proof uses the logic of the [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] to structure the argument: According to the [[Truth tables|truth table]] for $P \rightarrow Q$, the statement is true when $P$ is false; so we can begin the argument by assuming that $P$ is true. Then it only requires to show that $Q$ must also be true in that condition.
