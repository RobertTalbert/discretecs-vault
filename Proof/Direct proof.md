## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **direct proof** is a [[Proof|proof]] applied specifically to a [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] which is structured as follows: 
> 1. Assume that the [[Conditional statements|hypothesis]] of the conditional statement is true; 
> 2. Then use definitions, computations, previously-proven results, or basic facts to explain why the [[Conditional statements|conclusion]] of the conditional statement is true. 

Notes: 
- A direct proof uses the logic of the [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] to structure the argument: According to the [[Truth tables|truth table]] for $P \rightarrow Q$, the statement is true when $P$ is false; so we can begin the argument by assuming that $P$ is true. Then it only requires to show that $Q$ must also be true in that condition. 

## Examples and Non-Examples


> [!NOTE] Proof involving even and odd integers
> **Prove: If $n$ is an even integer, then $n^2$ is also even.** 
> 
> **Proof:** We use a direct proof. First, assume that $n$ is an [[Even and odd integers|even]] integer. 
> 
> Since $n$ is even, we can write it as $n = 2k$ where $k$ is another integer. (This is the definition of "[[even]]".) Now look at $n^2$: Since $n = 2k$, we know that $n^2 = (2k)^2$, which means $n^2 = 4k^2$ (using basic algebra to expand $(2k)^2$). We can factor off a $2$ from this to get $n^2 = 2(2k^2)$. Now since $k$ is an integer,
