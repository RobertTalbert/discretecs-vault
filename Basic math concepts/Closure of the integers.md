## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> We say the [[integers]] are **closed** under the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication to mean: 
> - The sum of any two [[integers]] is another [[Integers|integer]]. 
> - The difference of any two [[integers]] is another [[Integers|integer]].
> - The product of any two [[integers]] is another [[Integers|integer]]. 

Note: 
- We take the closure of the [[integers]] under addition, subtraction, and multiplication as basic facts about the [[set]] of [[integers]], with no [[proof]] required. 
- Closure is used mainly in [[Proof|proofs]] to support an argument that a certain computation results in an [[Integers|integer]]. For example, see the completed [[Proof|proofs]] in the [[Direct proof]] article. 
- If we replace "the [[integers]]" with some other [[set]] of numbers, closure may no longer hold. See below for examples. 
- If we replace "addition, subtraction, and multiplication" with other operations, closure may no longer hold. See below for examples. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- If the numbers $2a$ and $2b$ are [[integers]], then $2a+2b$ is an [[Integers|integer]] because of closure. So are $4ab$ (the product of $2a$ and $2b$) and $2a-2b$. 
- The [[integers]] are *not* closed under division, because one [[Integers|integer]] divided by another does not always result in another [[Integers|integer]]. For example $3$ and $5$ are [[integers]], but $3/5$ is not. 
- While the [[integers]] are closed under subtraction, the [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]] are not. For example $2$ and $7$ are [[natural numbers]] but $2-7$ is not, because it's negative. 
- While the [[integers]] are closed under addition, the [[subset]] $\{1,3,5\}$ is not: $1$ and $3$ are in this [[subset]] but $1+3$ is not.
