## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers. The plural of "matrix" is **matrices**. Matrices are composed of **rows** (that run horizontally or left-right) and **columns** (that run vertically or up-down). 
> 
> A matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is called an $m \times n$ ("m by n") matrix. A matrix that has the same number of rows as it has columns is called a **square** matrix. 
> 
> The **$(i,j)$-th element** of a matrix is the element that is in row $i$, column $j$. 

**Notes:**
- Matrices are usually enclosed in either large brackets, or large parentheses. 
- Matrices are a fundamental way to represent [[Graph|graphs]] and 

## Examples 

Here is an example of a $3 \times 2$ matrix: 
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$
This matrix is *not* square. The number $3$ is in row 3, column 2. That is, $3$ is the $(3,2)$ element of this matrix. 

Here is an example of a square matrix
