## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **degree** of a vertex in a [[Graph|graph]] is the number of edges that are [[incident]] to $v$. That is, it is the number of edges "coming out" of the vertex. If $v$ is a specific vertex, then its degree is denoted $\deg(v)$.

Notes: 
- If $G$ is the graph to which $v$ belongs as a vertex, we sometimes denote this by adding $G$ as a subscript: $\deg_G(v)$. 

## Examples 

Consider this graph:

The degrees each vertex are: 

| Vertex |    Degree     |
| :----: | :-----------: |
|   1    | $\deg(1) = 2$ |
|   2    |  $\deg(2) =   |
|   3    |               |
|   4    |               |
|   5    |               |
|   6    |               |
