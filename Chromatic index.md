## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Given a [[Graph|graph]] $G$, the **chromatic index** of $G$ is the minimum number of colors in any proper [[Edge coloring|edge coloring]] of $G$. We denote the chromatic index of $G$ by $\chi'(G)$. 

Notes:
- $\chi$ is the Greek letter "chi", pronounced "Kie" (rhymes with "pie"). The symbol $'$ next to the $\chi$ is pronounced "prime". 
- The notation for chromatic index is similar to that of the [[Chromatic number|chromatic number]], which is the minimum number of colors in any [[Vertex coloring|vertex coloring]] of $G$. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

For the [[Complete graph|complete graph]] $K_4$, the chromatic index is $\chi'. Here is an [[edge coloring]] with 3 colors that implements this:

An [[Edge coloring|edge coloring]] of $K_4$ with fewer than three colors is impossible, since each vertex has three edges [[Adjacent|incident]] with it, and each edge must receive a different color.
