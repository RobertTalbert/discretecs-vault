## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Given a [[Graph|graph]] $G$, the **chromatic index** of $G$ is the minimum number of colors in any proper [[Edge coloring|edge coloring]] of $G$. We denote the chromatic index of $G$ by $\chi'(G)$. 

Notes:
- $\chi$ is the Greek letter "chi", pronounced "Kie" (rhymes with "pie"). The symbol $'$ next to the $\chi$ i
