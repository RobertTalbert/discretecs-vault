## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Vizing's Theorem** states that **for any [[Graph|graph]] $G$, the [[Chromatic index|chromatic index]] $\chi'(G)$ is either $\Delta(G)$ or $\Delta(G) + 1$ where $\Delta(G)$ is the [[Degree|maximum degree]] of the graph.**  

Notes: 
- A [[Proof|proof]] of Vizing's Theorem using a combination of [[Mathematical induction|mathematical induction]] and [[Indirect proof|proof by contradiction]] can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizing%27s_theorem). 
- While it is easy to find $\Delta(G)$ in a graph, and therefore easy to narrow down $\chi'(G)$ to one of two numbers, it is not generally easy to classify which of the two numbers is the true [[chromatic index]]. 

## Examples 

In $K_{3,3}$, the complete bipartite graph with three [[Graph|vertices]] in each partition, the [[Degree|degree]] of each vertex is 3, and therefore either $\chi'(K_{3,3}) = 3$ or $\chi'(K_{3,3}) = 4$. In this case, it is easy to check that the [[Chromatic index|chromatic index]] is 3 and not 4, by direct demonstration of an [[Edge coloring|edge coloring]] using only three colors:
