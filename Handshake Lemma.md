## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> If $G = (V,E)$ is a graph, then the sum of the [[Degree|degrees]] of the [[Graph|vertices]] in $G$ is equal to twice the number of [[Graph|edges]] in $G$. That is, 
> $$\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2 |E|$$
> where $|E|$ is the [[Cardinality|cardinality]] of $E$. 

**Notes**: 
- The Handshake Lemma is a fundamental theoretical result about graphs and is used in numerous other theorems about them. 
- It is also of practical use, making it possible to count edges
