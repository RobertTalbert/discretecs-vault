## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> If $a$ and $b$ are two [[integers]], then we say **$b$ divides $a$** and write $b | a$ if there exists an integer $k$ such that $a = bk$. 

Notes: 
- If $b$ divides $a$, we can also say that $a$ is a multiple of $b$. 
- Note that the notation $a|b$ is not the fraction $a/b$ or $b/a$. The vertical bar is not a fraction bar, but shorthand for a statement about the relationship between $a$ and $b$. 
- Divisibility is a special case of the [[The division algorithm|Division Algorithm]] in which there is no remainder. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are integers, the Division Algorithm states that there must be integers $q$ and $r$ with $0 \leq r < b$ such that $a = bq + r$. If $r = 0$ in this case, then $b | a$. 
- If an integer $b$ *does not* divide the integer $a$, then we indicate this by putting a slash through the vertical bar: 

## Examples and Non-Examples

* $10 | 200$ because $200 = 20(10)$.
