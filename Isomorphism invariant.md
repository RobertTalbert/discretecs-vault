## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A property of a graph $G$ is said to be **isomorphism invariant** (or "an" isomorphism invariant) if for any other graph $H$ that is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $G$, $H$ also has that property. 

Notes: 
- In other words, an isomorphism invariant property "X" is one that satisfies this [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]]: If $G$ has property "X" and $G$ is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $H$, then $H$ has property "X".
