## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A [[Relation|relation]] $R$ on a set $X$ is said to be **symmetric** if, for any $a,b \in X$, if $(a,b) \in R$ then $(b,a) \in R$. 

Notes: 
- A relation *fails* to be symmetric if there is a pair $(a,b) \in R$ such that $(b,a) \not \in R$. 
- If we view the relation $R$ as a [[Directed graph|directed graph]], the relation is symmetric if every directed edge has a directed edge pointing in the opposite direction. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

* Let $\sim$ be the "rhymes with" relation on the set of all English words, so $w \sim v$ if word $w$ rhymes with word $v$. If word $w$ rhymes with word $v$ (example: "book" rhymes with "nook") then $v$ also rhymes with $w$ ("nook" rhymes with "book") so this relation
