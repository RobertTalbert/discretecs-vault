## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **Four Color Theorem** states that **every [[Planar graph|planar]] graph has a proper coloring with no more than four colors.** In other words, every planar graph is four-colorable. 

Notes: 
- The [[Contrapositive|contrapositive]] of the Four Color Theorem says: *If a graph does not have a 4-coloring (that is, a proper coloring with 4 colors) then the graph is not planar*. This provides one way to determine if a graph is non-planar. 
- However, the [[Converse|converse]] of the Four Color Theorem says: If a graph has a 4-coloring, then the graph is planar and this statement is **false**; see the examples below. Therefore the existence of a 4-
