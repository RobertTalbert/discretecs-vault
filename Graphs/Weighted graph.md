## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **weighted graph** is a [[Graph|graph]] in which every [[Graph|edge]] is assigned a numerical value which we call a **weight**. 

Notes: 
- The weights in a weighted graph can be [[Integers|integer]] or non-integer, positive or negative or zero. 
- A [[Directed graph|directed graph]] can also have weighted edges. 

## Examples

Here is an example of a weighted graph:

The weight of edge $\{3,4\}$ is 1. The weight of edge $\{5,6\}$ is 8. 

We can represent a weighted graph using
