## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **chromatic number** of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of colors in any proper [[Vertex coloring|vertex coloring]] of $G$. The chromatic number of $G$ is denoted $\chi(G)$. 

Notes
- $\chi$ is the Greek letter "chi", pronounced "Kie" (rhymes with "pie"). 
- A given graph can have many different possible proper [[Vertex coloring|colorings]]; for example we can just assign a different color to each vertex. But there is only one minimum number of colors needed for a proper coloring, and that number is $\chi(G)$. 

## Examples 

The chromatic number of $C_3$, the [[Cycle graph|cycle graph]] on three vertices, is $3$
