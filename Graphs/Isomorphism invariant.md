## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A property of a [[graph]] $G$ is said to be **isomorphism invariant** (or "an" isomorphism invariant) if for any other graph $H$ that is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $G$, $H$ also has that property. 

Notes: 
- In other words, an isomorphism invariant property "X" is one that satisfies this [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]]: If $G$ has property "X" and $G$ is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $H$, then $H$ has property "X". 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- The **number of [[Graph|vertices]]** in a graph is isomorphism invariant. If $G$ has $n$ vertices and $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, then $H$ must also have $n$ vertices -- because an [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]] is a [[Bijective|bijection]] between the vertex [[Set|sets]], therefore the vertex sets must have the same [[Cardinality|cardinality]]. 
- The **number of [[Graph|edges]]** in a graph is similarly isomorphism invariant. 
- **Having a vertex of a given [[degree]] is isomorphism invariant**. For example, if $G$ has a vertex of degree 6 and $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, then $H$ must also have a vertex of degree 6. Here is a proof of that assertion: 

Claim: If $G$ is a graph that has a vertex of degree $n$, and $G$ is isomorphic to $H$, then $H$ also has a vertex of degree $n$. 

Proof: Assume that $G$ has a vertex (label it as $v$) with degree $n$, and that $G$ is isomorphic to $H$. We want to sh
