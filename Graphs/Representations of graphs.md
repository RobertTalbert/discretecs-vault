## Definition 

[[Graph|Graphs]] can be **represented** in different ways, each having its own particular use case. Here are some of the most common representations. 

*As a visual diagram or network*. This is one of the most common ways that we think about graphs -- as a visual network of [[Graph|nodes]] (often) connected by [[Graph|edges]]. Visual representations make it simple to understand the properties and behavior of a graph, but they are not very useful when using a computer to analyze a graph, or when the graph contains a very large number of nodes or edges.

As a pair of sets (vertex set + edge set). The definition of a [[Graph|graph]] gives a graph as a pair of sets: The first set is the set of vertices, and the second set is the set of edges. For example the graph above, given visually, is 
$$G = (\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\})

As a list of edges. 

As a list of adjacencies. 

As a Python dictionary. 

As an adjacency matrix.
