## Definition 

[[Graph|Graphs]] can be **represented** in different ways, each having its own particular use case. 

*As a visual diagram or network*. This is one of the most common ways that we think about graphs -- as a visual network of nodes (often) connected by edges.  

As a pair of sets (vertex set + edge set).
