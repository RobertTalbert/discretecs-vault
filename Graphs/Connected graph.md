## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A [[graph]] $G$ is **connected** if, for every pair of distinct [[Graph|vertices]] $u$ and $v$, there is a [[Paths|walk]] or a [[Paths|path]] from $u$ to $v$. Otherwise we say that $G$ is **disconnected**. A **component** of a graph is a maximal connected [[Subgraph|subgraph]]. 

**Notes**: 
- Another way of saying a graph is "disconnected" is that there exist at least two distinct vertices with no walk or path from one to the other. 
- Another way of saying "component" is that a component is a connected piece of a graph that is as large as possible while still being connected. 
## Examples and Non-Examples

In this picture, the red graph on the left is connected but the blue one on the right is disconnected:
