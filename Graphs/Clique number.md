## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **clique** in a [[Graph|graph]] is a set of vertices which are all pairwise adjacent; that is, it is a subgraph of the graph that is a copy of the [[Complete graph|complete graph]] $K_n$. The **clique number** of a graph is the largest $n$ for which there is a clique of size $n$ in the graph. 

Notes: 
* "Clique" is pronounced "CLEEK". 
* The common use of the term "clique" refers to a subgroup of people within a large group, and everyone in the subgroup knows everyone else in the subgroup. That is the same sense as what's meant in a graph.
