## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> If $n \geq 1$, the **path graph** $P_n$ is the graph that is the [[Paths|path]] on $n$ vertices. It can be represented as 
> - The [[Graph|vertex]] set $\{1,2,\dots, n\}$
> - The [[Graph|edge]] set $\{\{1,2\}, \{2,3\}, \dots, \{n-1, n\}\}$

Notes: 
- Different labelings of the vertices are possible in $P_n$, but the edges must represent the path between the vertices. There is only one such path up to [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]]. 
- $P_1$ is just a single vertex with no edges. 
- $P_2$ is a single edge with two vertices. 
- The path graph $P_n$ is a [[Paths|path]] of length $n-1$.
