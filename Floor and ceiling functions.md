## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> 1. The **floor function**, denoted $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$, is a [[Function|function]] from the set of real numbers to the set of [[Integers|integers]] defined by taking the input and rounding down to the next lower integer. 
> 2. The **ceiling function**, denoted $g(x) = \lceil x \rceil$, is a [[Function|function]] from the set of real numbers to the set of [[Integers|integers]] defined by taking the input and rounding up to the next higher integer. 

Notes: 
- In Python, the floor and ceiling functions are accessed by first loading the `math` library and then accessing `floor` or `ceil` as methods: 

```python
import math
math.floor(3.4)
# Result: 3

import math # Not necessary to load this a second time 
math.ceil(3.4)
# Result: 4
```
