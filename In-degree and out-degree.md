## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> In a [[Directed graph|digraph]] $G$, the **out-degree** of a vertex $v$ is the number of edges for which $v$ is the head. The **in-degree** of a vertex $v$ is the number of edges for which $v$ is the tail. We use $d_G^+(v)$ to denote the out-degree and $d_G^-(v)$ to denote the in-degree.
