## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A [[Relation|relation]] $R$ on a set $X$ is said to be **transitive** if, for any $a,b,c \in X$, if $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R$, then $(a,c) \in R$. 

**Notes**: 
* A relation *fails* to be transitive if there are pairs $(a,b)$ and $(b,c)$ in $R$, but $(a,c) \not \in R$. 
* If we view the relation $R$ as a [[Directed graph|directed graph]], then the relation is transitive if it is already equal to its [[Transitive closure|transitive closure]].
