> Given a [[Directed graph|directed graph]] $G$, the **transitive closure** of $G$ is another directed graph denoted $G^+$  in which: 
> 1. The vertices are the same as those of $G$, and 
> 2. Given two vertices $a$ and $b$, there is a directed edge $(a,b)$ in $G^+$ if there is a directed [[Paths|path]] from $a$ to $b$ in the original digraph $G$ that uses at leas
