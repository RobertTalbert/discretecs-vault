## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> An **equivalence relation** is a [[relation]] that is [[Reflexive property|reflexive]], [[Symmetric property|symmetric]], and [[Transitive property|transitive]]. 

Notes: 
- The three properties required for an equivalence relation are the essential properties of mathematical relations that are similar to "equality". 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- Let $\sim$ be the "rhymes with" relation on the set of all English words, so $w \sim v$ if word $w$ rhymes with word $v$. This relation is [[Reflexive property|reflexive]] (every word rhymes with itself), [[Symmetric property|symmetric]] (i)
