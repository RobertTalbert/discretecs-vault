## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> An **equivalence relation** is a [[relation]] that is [[Reflexive property|reflexive]], [[Symmetric property|symmetric]], and [[Transitive property|transitive]]. 

Notes: 
- The three properties required for an equivalence relation are the essential properties of mathematical relations that are similar to "equality". 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- Let $\sim$ be the "rhymes with" relation on the set of all English words, so $w \sim v$ if word $w$ rhymes with word $v$. This relation is [[Reflexive property|reflexive]] (every word rhymes with itself), [[Symmetric property|symmetric]] (if word 1 rhymes with word 2, then word 2 rhymes with word 1) and [[Transitive property|transitive]] (if word 1 rhymes with word 2 and word 2 rhymes with word 3 then word 1 rhymes with word 3). So it is an equivalence relation. 
- Let $\sim$ be the relation on the set $\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers, such that $a \sim b$ if $a \, \% \, 10 = b \, \% \, 10$ where $\%$ is the [[The modulus operator|modulus operator]]. This is an equivalence relation. 
- Let $\sim$ be the relation on the set $\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers, such that $a \sim b$ if $a < b$. This is **not** an equivalence relation because it is not [[Reflexive property|reflexive]]: For example $1 \not
