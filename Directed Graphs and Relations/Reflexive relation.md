## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A [[Relation|relation]] $R$ on a set $X$ is said to be **reflexive** if $(a,a) \in R$ for all $a \in X$. 

Notes: 
- In other words a relation is reflexive if every element of the ground set $X$ is related to itself. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

* Define a relation $\sim$ on the set $X = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ using the following rule: $a \sim b$ [[Biconditional statement|if and only if]] $a$ [[Divisibility|divides]] $b$ (that is, $b$ is a multiple of $a$). Then, since every element of $X$ divides itself (according to the definition of [[Divisibility|divides]])
