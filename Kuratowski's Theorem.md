## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Kuratowski's Theorem** states that a finite [[Graph|graph]] is [[Planar graph|planar]] if and only if it does not contain a [[Subgraph|subgraph]] that is a subdivision of $K_5$ (the [[Complete graph|complete graph]] on 5 vertices) or $K_{3,3}$ the complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition.
