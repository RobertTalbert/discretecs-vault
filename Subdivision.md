## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Suppose $G$ and $H$ are [[Graph|graphs]]. We say $H$ is a **subdivision** of $G$ if $H$ is obtained from $G$ by replacing [[Graph|edges]] of $G$ with [[Paths|paths]] of any lengths. The [[Graph|vertices]] of $H$ that correspond to directly to the vertices of $G$ are called **branch vertices**. 

Notes: 
- Visually, a graph $H$ is a subdivision of another graph $G$ if we take $G$ and add new vertices to it along existing edges, "splitting up" the edges with those vertices. 

## Example

Consider this graph $G$ with 4 vertices and 5 edges:
